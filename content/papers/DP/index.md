##### Abstract

Installing smart meters to publish real-time electricity rates has been controversial while it might lead to
privacy concerns. Dispatched rates include fine-grained data
on aggregate electricity consumption in a zone and could
potentially be used to infer a household’s pattern of energy use
or its occupancy. In this paper, we propose Blowfish privacy to
protect the occupancy state of the houses connected to a smart
grid. First, we introduce a Markov model of the relationship
between electricity rate and electricity consumption. Next, we
develop an algorithm that perturbs electricity rates before
publishing them to ensure users’ privacy. Last, the proposed
algorithm is tested on data inspired by household occupancy
models and its performance is compared to an alternative
solution.
